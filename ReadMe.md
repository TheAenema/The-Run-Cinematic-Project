# The Run (走れ) : Cinematic Cutscene Project 

A project focused on creating a AAA-quality cinematic cutscene using the Blazium Engine a fork of Godot Engine.

## Background

This project aimed at pushing all the limits of the Godot Engine in graphics and animation capabilities. I've implemented various shaders to achieve the quality I wanted such as [Six-Way Volumetric Lighting](https://github.com/TheAenema/Godot-Six-Way-Volumetric-Shader) shader for Fire, Smoke, Explosions and Steam along with a Limitless Vertex Animation Texture  (VAT) shader to simulate cloth simulations.

The entire project was animated and created in Autodesk 3ds Max 2023 then ported to the Blazium Engine to set up rendering and presentation. 

> **Note :** This project does not depend on any third-party tool or library; everything is built with existing tools, and it can run inside Godot, Blazium, and Redot.

## Project Details

- Engine Version : 4.3+
- Time to Finish : 8 Days
- Size On Disk : 475,051,098 bytes
- License : CC BY 4.0

## Requirements

To run the project at optimal quality the following equipment is required:

- A high-performance graphics card (Project was built using a GeForce RTX 3080ti 12GB)
- Godot, Blazium, or Redot version 4.3+ (Project was created in Blazium 4.3.9 Windows 11 x64 Build)
- Vulkan Renderer Support

> For weaker GPUs the FSR 2.0 feature can be utilized to maintain performance. However, ensure the project runs at a solid 60FPS to stay in sync with the theme song.

## Highlights

This project contains the following elements that can be used for educational purposes:

- Biped + Destruction + Full Scene Animations
- Fully Dynamic Lighting with zero usage of Lightmaps
- Advanced Visual Effects including Fire, Smoke, Explosion, Steam, Laser, Lens Flare etc.
- Double Camera Motion Setup (Animated + Hand-Held Captured)
- Looped Mesh Animation using Vertex Animation Texture (VAT)
